Cloud PoodLL Recording Question
========================================
Thanks for downloading Cloud Poodll question type.

There should be only one folder "cloudpoodll" in the cloudpoodll folder after you unzip the zip file.
Place this folder into your moodle installation under the [site_root]/question/type folder.

Then login to your site as admin and go to your Moodle site's top page. Moodle should then guide you through the installation or upgrade.

You will need a Cloud Poodll API user and secret. Get those from Poodll.com. See https://poodll.com/plugin-cloudpoodll-recording-question/


Good luck.
